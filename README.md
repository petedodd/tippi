# TODO

- identify bl data in report
- trace ASM & BC inputs
- finish commenting and tidying modeldata.R
- particular attention to including extra countries
- other York thresholds
- need to split out HIV entry ATT when cost merging?
- different screening costs?
- query zero screening costs
- CMR LSO missing cascade tabs
- NAs in results for ATT - down to missing countries in ASM <- trace
- understanding (HH vs facility CT) (also HIV vs not split)
- update WHO notifications
- consolidate other TODO s

test

Questions:
- ACF using FB screen cost?


# TODO from Nyasha call

- need to check unit costs, traceperhhcpt, totindexscreen - all mean the right thing
-> unit cost is per child contact screened
-> use data in Martina email to update HHCM cascade/split
- check logic of nhh ACF bits
- go back include the right entry-point splits

ACF:
- make sure that case-finding here does not include HHCM ACF
 -> query about whether INT row 2 includes HHCM screenings or not?
 (probably does include)
 (expect smaller; should be able to manage if not - see pt 3)
- HIV vs non-HIV entrypoint
-> what data has this in? new spreadsheet

Any unused costs? X-ray?
probably enters in analogous way to Xpert

see also joint intervention

---- 

PETE
- spreadsheet on splits for PT and ICF
- think about where Xray goes
- NA bug in ATT
- HH screen split (from ICF)
- overall cost drivers correct
- structuring the appendix

NYASHA
- costing code base
- add to appendix on costing (relies on Pete outlining)
- York thresholds?
- fu w/Sushant
